Displays all public lists or most recent items added to Kippt.

== Description ==
Kippt is a social bookmarking service to easily share and save things you find on the web so you and your friends can come back to them later. 
This widget lets you easily show your visitors on your wordpress site all the cool stuff you find on the internet, without even having to think about it.
It either displays all your public lists on Kippt or the most recent items you have added to Kippt.

== Installation ==
1. Get the zip [Here](https://github.com/kekeblom/kippt-wordpress/raw/master/kippt-widget.zip)
2. Upload, install and activate it on your Wordpress blog or site like any other plugin
3. Go to the widget page and drag it to the widget area of your choice -- no biggie.
4. Fill in the title, your username or email and your api token, which you can get [here](https://kippt.com/developers/#apikey).
5. Pick the desired behaviour. That's it, you're ready to go!


If the widget doesn't work on your site and you have double checked your username and api token, let me know. Your web host probably doesn't have curl enabled.

All feature suggestions are welcome!

## To come
* I'll probably add functionality to only show clips from a certain list
* Some way to refresh the widget on certain intervals instead of getting the the info on every page load.
